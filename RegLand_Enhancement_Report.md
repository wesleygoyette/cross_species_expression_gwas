## Key Achievements

### 📊 Database Enhancements
- ✅ Enhanced SQLite database (1.31GB → 1.92GB)
- ✅ Created `enhancers_hiconf` view (121,348 high-confidence enhancers)  
- ✅ Populated `gene_to_enhancer_annot` table (1,911,414 mappings)
- ✅ Added tissue coverage analysis and quality monitoring
- ✅ Normalized species data (human, mouse, pig, chicken, macaque)

### 🔧 API Integration  
- ✅ New quality endpoints: `/api/quality/summary/` and `/api/quality/tissues/`
- ✅ Enhanced existing endpoints with quality metadata
- ✅ Added tissue coverage warnings and recommendations
- ✅ Integrated quality indicators into Django backend

### ⚛️ Frontend Ready
- ✅ React application running (localhost:3000)
- ✅ Node.js environment configured
- ✅ Complete development setup operational
- ✅ Ready for enhanced API integration

## Quality Assessment Results

### Data Coverage Analysis
- **Total Enhancers:** 2,708,836 across all species
- **Score Coverage:** 100.0% (excellent)
- **High-Confidence Rate:** 4.5% (121,348 premium enhancers)
- **Gene-Enhancer Mappings:** 1.9M+ relationships with distance calculations

### Tissue Quality Matrix
| Tissue | Count | Level | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Heart  | 72,564 | Good | ✅ Recommended |
| Brain  | 48,784 | Good | ✅ Recommended |  
| Liver  | 23 | Critical | ❌ Use mouse liver instead |

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `backend/regland_api/views.py` - Added quality API endpoints
