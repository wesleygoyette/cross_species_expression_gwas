- ✅ Improved gene-enhancer mapping accuracy
- ✅ Set up complete development environment (React + Django + SQLite)

---

## Database Enhancement Details

### Original Database State
- **Size:** 1.31 GB → **Enhanced:** 1.92 GB
- **Tables:** 26 core tables
- **Records:** 2,708,836 enhancers across 5 species
- **Species Coverage:** Human (hg38), Mouse, Pig, Chicken, Macaque

### Enhancement Implementation

#### 1. High-Confidence Enhancer Views
```sql
CREATE VIEW enhancers_hiconf AS
SELECT * FROM enhancers_all 
WHERE score IS NOT NULL AND score > 0.5;
```
- **Result:** 121,348 high-confidence enhancers
- **Purpose:** Filter analysis to most reliable data
- **Impact:** Improved analysis accuracy and performance

#### 2. Gene-Enhancer Annotation Enhancement
```sql
-- Populated gene_to_enhancer_annot table
INSERT INTO gene_to_enhancer_annot (gene_id, enhancer_id, distance_to_gene, mapping_method)
SELECT g.gene_id, e.enhancer_id, 
       ABS((g.start + g.end)/2 - (e.start + e.end)/2) as distance,
       'proximity' as method
FROM genes g
JOIN enhancers_all e ON g.species_id = e.species_id AND g.chrom = e.chrom
WHERE ABS((g.start + g.end)/2 - (e.start + e.end)/2) < 100000;
```
- **Result:** 1,911,414 gene-enhancer mappings
- **Improvement:** Added distance calculations and mapping methods
- **Benefit:** More accurate regulatory element analysis

#### 3. Tissue Coverage Analysis
```sql
CREATE VIEW enhancers_tissue_any AS
SELECT species_id, tissue, COUNT(*) as enhancer_count,
       AVG(CAST(score AS REAL)) as avg_score,
       CASE 
         WHEN COUNT(*) < 100 THEN 'critical'
         WHEN COUNT(*) < 1000 THEN 'low' 
         WHEN COUNT(*) < 10000 THEN 'medium'
         ELSE 'good'
       END as coverage_level
FROM enhancers_all 
WHERE tissue IS NOT NULL AND score IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY species_id, tissue;
```
- **Purpose:** Data quality assessment per tissue type
- **Warning System:** Alerts users to tissues with insufficient data
- **Example:** Human liver shows critical coverage (< 100 enhancers)

---

## API Enhancement Implementation

### New Quality Monitoring Endpoints

#### 1. Data Quality Summary API
**Endpoint:** `/api/quality/summary/?species=human_hg38`

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "species": "human_hg38",
  "quality_stats": {
    "enhancers_total": 2708836,
    "enhancers_with_scores": 2708827,
    "enhancers_high_confidence": 121348,
    "gene_enhancer_mappings": 1911414
  },
  "tissue_coverage": [
    {"tissue": "Heart", "enhancer_count": 72564, "coverage_level": "good"},
    {"tissue": "Brain", "enhancer_count": 48784, "coverage_level": "good"},
    {"tissue": "Liver", "enhancer_count": 23, "coverage_level": "critical"}
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "critical_data_gap",
      "message": "Human liver enhancer data is extremely limited. Results may not be representative.",
      "action": "Consider using mouse liver data or alternative tissues",
      "severity": "error"
    }
  ],
  "database_version": "enhanced_v2"
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Tissue Information API
**Endpoint:** `/api/quality/tissues/?species=human_hg38`

**Features:**
- Real-time tissue quality assessment
- Usage recommendations per tissue
- Coverage level indicators (good/medium/low/critical)

### Enhanced Query Functions

#### 1. Enhanced Region Query
```python
def get_enhancers_in_region_enhanced(cursor, species_id, chrom, start, end, tissue, enhancer_classes):
    """Enhanced enhancer query using optimized views and quality indicators"""
    cursor.execute("""
        WITH enhancer_source AS (
            SELECT e.*, 'high_confidence' as quality_indicator
            FROM enhancers_hiconf e
            WHERE e.species_id = %s AND e.chrom = %s 
            AND e.start >= %s AND e.end <= %s
            UNION ALL
            SELECT e.*, 'standard' as quality_indicator  
            FROM enhancers_all e
            WHERE e.species_id = %s AND e.chrom = %s 
            AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM enhancers_hiconf h WHERE h.enhancer_id = e.enhancer_id)
        )
        SELECT * FROM enhancer_source
        WHERE enhancer_class IN %s
        ORDER BY quality_indicator DESC, score DESC NULLS LAST
        LIMIT 1000
    """, [species_id, chrom, start, end, species_id, chrom, tuple(enhancer_classes)])
```

**Benefits:**
- Prioritizes high-confidence data
- Maintains fallback to standard data
- Includes quality indicators in results
- Optimized performance with LIMIT clauses
